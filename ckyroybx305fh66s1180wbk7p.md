## 8 Best React Native Project Ideas for Beginners

Dear Developers, You've come to the perfect place if you want to study React Native and are looking for unique project ideas and tutorials. In this blog, I'll show you some fun and interesting projects to help you understand React Native.

Building projects, in my experience of learning many different tech skills, including React Native, is the greatest method to learn any new technology, including React Native.

Once you start working on a project, you'll learn how to put everything you've learned into practice, and React Native allows you to create cross-platform apps that run natively on both Android and iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad.

The best method to learn any programming language, including React native, is to practice as often as possible by developing as many projects as possible. This will give you some experience and allow you to take advantage of the language's features.


# 1. Create a Google Login Option

Gmail is the default email for more than 1.5 billion people, thus you'll try to create the Google login option within your app in this project by designing any kind of app you want and then adding this option to it using the React Native and Firebase SDK.

The project has already been published as an article on freeCodeCamp called How to Set Up Google Login, which explains to you how to implement it in your React Native app step by step, so be sure to check it out if you're having trouble.

# 2. Add Navigation Menu

In this project, you will construct a navigation menu, similar to the burger icon, that when clicked, reveals the pages available within that app, as well as a bottom navigation menu that allows you to switch between pages, and these features should be implemented in all apps.

This project can be simply implemented using the React native language, but if you find it challenging, you may learn how to do it in React native by watching this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayxRtBHw754)

# 3. Build an Instagram Clone in React Native

This is yet another project you may work on to understand React Native UI, how to construct a backend with Firebase, and a few other key React Native concepts.

You don't have to create a full-fledged Instagram clone, but you may include crucial features like the ability to upload and share photos, create a buddy list, and follow people.

You can watch this [freecodecamp project-based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPgQWbWmEk) course on YouTube if you need a resource to follow along.

# 4. Build Cryptocurrency Tracker App

This project will function similarly to a cryptocurrency tracker app, displaying the current cryptocurrency price, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, in relation to the US dollar in real-time, as well as their trendings, such as the percent of change whether the price rises or falls.

The project should be simple and uncomplicated, but if you're having trouble implementing it because of the API or something else, you may take this free [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-react-native-with-firebase/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-mRkgL.lI1cCF1Kv7bdA_MA&LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads) called "Building a Cryptocurrency Tracker App" to assist you out.

# 5. Build Video Calling App With React Native

Building a Facetime or VIBER-like video conferencing app is another wonderful project idea for learning the React Native API and SDK. You'll learn how to use React Native to access the camera and microphone, as well as several other important SDK features.

If you need assistance, this [YouTube instructional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb70_TXRQNE) is a good place to start. 

In this article, you'll learn how to use React Native to create a video and voice/audio calling mobile app for iOS and Android. This React Native tutorial is perfect for beginners because it walks you through everything from getting started with React Native to integrating video calling features.

You'll have built a video calling app with the following capabilities by the end of this series:

1. Contacts Authentication List
2. Making a phone call and receiving a call
3. Only video and voice calls are allowed.
4. Navigation

# 6. Build a Food Delivery App Using React Native

It's a good idea to learn React Native by building a food delivery app like DoorDash, Zomato, Swiggy, or Foodpanda.

It's a complicated project that necessitates a lot of client-server interaction, but it will provide you with enough experience to work on any actual project, which is why I recommend it to novices.

If you need a resource, look no further than this free [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAXQh_Zk9Kk&list=PLAP1EsuzlGNJYvsJzRE8owOzWEhIuZe3i), which will teach you how to create a complete food delivery app using React-Native and Firebase and then publish it to the Play Store and App Store.

# 7.  Build The Tinder App Clone

In this project, you will create a social networking app that allows users to log in and register using their Facebook accounts, as well as search for each other's profiles. You will also use geolocation features to match people and receive notifications when someone likes your profile.

This project is designed for advanced React Native developers, and those who are having difficulty creating this type of app can refer to this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-build-tinder/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-az3sqSyZNOSaC3nz4LMngQ&LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads) called How To Build Tinder, which will show you exactly how to build this project from the start to finish.

# 8. Build Chatting App [WhatsApp Clone]

This project is comparable to making a chat application like Messenger, where the other person can send you messages and you can reply, but with a simple user interface that isn't overly difficult, such as having a profile or images, and so on.

The project is simple to do because it does not need the creation of a complex social network app, but if you have any difficulties, you might want to check out this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-react-native-by-building-a-chat-app/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-A6thwh5T0Fie1YLdjrZXQA&LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads) called constructing a chat app, which will walk you through everything you need to know step by step.

# Summary

That's all there is to it when it comes to the greatest React Native project ideas for beginners. We've looked at nearly eight projects that you can make to learn about React Native and its features.

That's all there is to learning React Native using React Native projects. No matter how much you've learned and seen tutorials about React Native, you won't be able to master it (or any other language) unless you create projects and practice on your own, and you've seen numerous projects to help you get started as a React Native developer in this post.

I would highly recommend going through this playlist to start your React Native Journey
